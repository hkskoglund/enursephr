    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="C">
        Older people in contact with health care
        professionals should be asked routinely whether
        they have fallen in the past year and asked about
        the frequency, context and characteristics of the
        fall/s.
      </Evidence>
    </Recommendation>

    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="C">
        Older people reporting a fall or considered at risk
        of falling should be observed for balance and gait
        deficits and considered for their ability to benefit
        from interventions to improve strength and
        balance.

  <RecommendationContainer Header="Multifactorial falls risk assessment" >
    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="C">
        Older people who present for medical attention
        because of a fall, or report recurrent falls in the past
        year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or
        balance should be offered a multifactorial falls risk
        assessment.This assessment should be performed
        by a health care professional with appropriate skills
        and experience, normally in the setting of a
        specialist falls service. This assessment should be
        part of an individualised,multifactorial
        intervention.
      </Evidence>
    </Recommendation>
    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="C">
        Multifactorial assessment may include the
        following:

  <RecommendationContainer Header="Multifactorial interventions" >
    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="A">
        All older people with recurrent falls or assessed as
        being at increased risk of falling should be
        considered for an individualised multifactorial
        intervention.
      </Evidence>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="A">
        In successful multifactorial intervention
        programmes the following specific components are
        common – against a background of the general
        diagnosis and management of causes and
        recognised risk factors:

    <Recommendation>
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="A">
        Following treatment for an injurious fall, older
        people should be offered a multidisciplinary
        assessment to identify and address future risk and
        individualised intervention aimed at promoting
        independence and improving physical and
        psychological function.

    <Recommendation >
      <Evidence EvidenceGrade="A" EvidenceUrl="">
        Strength and balance training is recommended.
        Those most likely to benefit are older communitydwelling
        people with a history of recurrent falls
        and/or balance and gait deficit.A musclestrengthening
        and balance programme should be
        offered. This should be individually prescribed and
        monitored by an appropriately trained
        professional.
